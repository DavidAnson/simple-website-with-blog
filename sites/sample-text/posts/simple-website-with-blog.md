> A simple website with a blog

`simple-website-with-blog` is a simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) web application for static content that includes a blog.
It was created as the basis for [my own website](https://dlaa.me/), but everyone is welcome to use it.
The implementation strives to be simple and free of unnecessary dependencies.
